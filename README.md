⚡ **Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies, instant startup  
🎯 **Educational** - Designed for clear understanding and learning  

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Terminal-only** - Pure console applications, no UI dependencies
- **Minimal code** - Essential code for maximum clarity
- **No databases** - In-memory storage, no setup complexity
- **Clear output** - Visual progress indicators and formatted results
- **Fast execution** - Quick demonstrations of capabilities
- **Progressive complexity** - Build skills step by step

## 📚 Projects Overview

### 🔍 Project 1: Simple Webset Search (⭐ Beginner)
**File:** `1_simple_webset_search.py`  
**Lines of Code:** ~80

The perfect starting point! Learn webset basics with minimal code:
- Create websets with search queries
- Wait for completion
- Display results clearly in terminal

**Dependencies:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`

---

### 📊 Project 2: Enriched Webset Analyzer (⭐⭐ Intermediate)
**File:** `2_enriched_webset_analyzer.py`  
**Lines of Code:** ~120

Add intelligence to your searches with enrichments:
- Search with custom criteria
- Extract specific data using enrichments
- Export results to CSV with terminal progress

**Dependencies:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `pandas`

---

### 🔔 Project 3: Webset Monitor (⭐⭐⭐ Advanced)
**File:** `3_webset_monitor_dashboard.py`  
**Lines of Code:** ~100

Real-time monitoring with in-memory tracking:
- Create monitors for continuous tracking
- Terminal-based status updates
- Simple duplicate detection with sets

**Dependencies:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install requests python-dotenv pandas

# Set up environment variables
cp env_example.txt .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Usage Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Project 1 to establish concepts
2. **Follow Progress**: Each project displays clear progress indicators
3. **Understand Output**: All projects have formatted, readable terminal output
4. **Build Complexity**: Each project builds on previous concepts
5. **No Setup Complexity**: No databases or complex configurations needed

### Execution

Each project is designed for smooth operation:
- Clear console output with emojis and formatting
- Reasonable execution times
- Error handling for common issues
- Progressive feedback during processing
- No external dependencies on browsers, databases, or complex setups

## 📋 Requirements by Project

| Project | Dependencies | Data Storage |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | requests, python-dotenv | Memory only |
| 2 | requests, python-dotenv, pandas | Memory + CSV export |
| 3 | requests, python-dotenv | Memory (sets for deduplication) |

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Copy `env_example.txt` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required for all projects
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
```

That's it! No complex configurations needed.

### No Additional Setup Required
- ✅ No database installation
- ✅ No complex ML libraries
- ✅ No web servers
- ✅ No external services (except APIs)

## 💡 Best Practices

### Before Running:
1. Test each project thoroughly
2. Prepare your API keys
3. Clear your terminal for clean output
4. Review expected outputs

### During Execution:
1. Follow each step carefully
2. Understand the code structure
3. Run projects step by step
4. Monitor key output sections
5. Keep terminal window focused

### Code Understanding:
1. Review imports and setup (minimal)
2. Understand the main class structure (simple)
3. Study key methods (concise)
4. Follow the main execution flow (linear)
5. Analyze the terminal output (clear)

## 📖 Learning Path

**Beginner** → Start with Project 1, understand basic concepts  
**Intermediate** → Move to Project 2, learn enrichments  
**Advanced** → Tackle Project 3, master monitoring
