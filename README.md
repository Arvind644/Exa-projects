# Exa Websets - Python Projects (Minimal Terminal Collection)

Welcome to the **Exa Websets Minimal Terminal Collection** - 3 progressively complex Python projects designed specifically for YouTube video demonstrations! Each project is streamlined to the absolute minimum code necessary, completely terminal-based, and perfect for recording coding tutorials.

## ✨ Minimal Design Philosophy

🖥️ **Terminal-Only** - Pure console applications, no UI dependencies  
📝 **Minimal Code** - Absolute minimum lines for maximum learning  
💾 **No Databases** - All data stored in memory, no persistence complexity  
⚡ **Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies, instant startup  
📺 **Video-Perfect** - Designed specifically for clear video demonstrations  

## 🎥 Video-Ready Features

- **Terminal-only** - Pure console applications, no UI dependencies
- **Minimal code** - Absolute minimum lines for maximum clarity
- **No databases** - In-memory storage, no setup complexity
- **Clear output** - Visual progress indicators and formatted results
- **Fast execution** - Optimized for demo timeframes
- **Progressive complexity** - Build skills step by step

## 📚 Projects Overview

### 🔍 Project 1: Simple Webset Search (⭐ Beginner)
**File:** `1_simple_webset_search.py`  
**Demo Time:** ~5 minutes  
**Lines of Code:** ~80

The perfect starting point! Learn webset basics with minimal code:
- Create websets with search queries
- Wait for completion
- Display results clearly in terminal

**Dependencies:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`

### 📊 Project 2: Enriched Webset Analyzer (⭐⭐ Intermediate)
**File:** `2_enriched_webset_analyzer.py`  
**Demo Time:** ~8 minutes  
**Lines of Code:** ~120

Add intelligence to your searches with enrichments:
- Search with custom criteria
- Extract specific data using enrichments
- Export results to CSV with terminal progress

**Dependencies:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `pandas`

### 🔔 Project 3: Webset Monitor (⭐⭐⭐ Advanced)
**File:** `3_webset_monitor_dashboard.py`  
**Demo Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Lines of Code:** ~100

Real-time monitoring with in-memory tracking:
- Create monitors for continuous tracking
- Terminal-based status updates
- Simple duplicate detection with sets

**Dependencies:** `requests`, `python-dotenv`

## 🚀 Quick Start for Video Recording

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install minimal dependencies only!
pip install requests python-dotenv pandas

# Set up environment variables
cp env_example.txt .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Recording Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Project 1 to establish concepts
2. **Show Progress**: Each project displays clear progress indicators
3. **Explain Output**: All projects have formatted, readable terminal output
4. **Build Complexity**: Each project builds on previous concepts
5. **No Setup**: No databases or complex configurations needed

### Video-Friendly Execution

Each project is designed to run smoothly for video demos:
- Clear console output with emojis and formatting
- Reasonable execution times (5-15 minutes max)
- Error handling for common issues
- Progressive feedback during processing
- No external dependencies on browsers, databases, or complex setups

## 📋 Requirements by Project

| Project | Dependencies | Data Storage |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | requests, python-dotenv | Memory only |
| 2 | requests, python-dotenv, pandas | Memory + CSV export |
| 3 | requests, python-dotenv | Memory (sets for deduplication) |

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Copy `env_example.txt` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required for all projects
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
```

That's it! No complex configurations needed.

### No Additional Setup Required
- ✅ No database installation
- ✅ No complex ML libraries
- ✅ No web servers
- ✅ No external services (except APIs)

## 🎬 Video Recording Best Practices

### Before Recording:
1. Test each project thoroughly
2. Prepare your API keys
3. Clear your terminal/IDE
4. Have example outputs ready

### During Recording:
1. Explain each step clearly
2. Show the code structure first
3. Run the project step by step
4. Highlight key output sections
5. Keep terminal window focused

### Code Walkthrough Tips:
1. Start with imports and setup (minimal)
2. Explain the main class structure (simple)
3. Walk through key methods (concise)
4. Show the main execution flow (linear)
5. Demonstrate the terminal output (clear)

## 📖 Learning Path

**Beginner** → Start with Project 1, understand basic concepts  
**Intermediate** → Move to Project 2, learn enrichments  
**Advanced** → Tackle Project 3, master monitoring
